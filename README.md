## Introduction

I am a PhD student at The University of Edinburgh where I work in close association with the [CLE](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/) (Centre for Language Evolution) and my research is conducted under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Culbertson and Professor Simon Kirby.



### Research summary

My PhD research investigates the origins of cross-linguistic patterns in NPs using experimental methods. I am especially interested in artificial language learning, and gestural experiments, and their reflection on the cognitive features involved in language creation and use. I also conduct research on language development/acquisition, focusing mainly on phonological segmentation and the typological frequency of syllable patterns in infant directed speech. This latter research has been done in collaboration with Dr. Mits Ota and Dr. Barbora Skarabela and the team at [ELfLanD](https://www.elfland.ppls.ed.ac.uk/).
