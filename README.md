## Introduction

<img src="https://annieholtz.github.io/images/annie.png" width="172">  
I am a PhD student at The University of Edinburgh where I work in close association with the [CLE](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/) (Centre for Language Evolution) and my research is conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io/) and [Professor Simon Kirby](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/).



### Research summary

My PhD research compares naturalness and simplicity phenomena acorss phonology and syntax using experimental methods. I am especially interested in how the learnability of natural and simple systems affects typological regularities and how natural and simple patterns are generalised to new forms by learners. I also conduct research on language development/acquisition, focusing mainly on phonological segmentation in relation to the typological frequency of syllable patterns in infant directed speech. This latter research has been done in collaboration with [Dr. Mits Ota](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~mits/) and Dr. Barbora Skarabela and the team at [ELfLanD](https://www.elfland.ppls.ed.ac.uk/).
